I hereby release you
You god damn lying fool

You are suspended in time
Hanging naked from a barbwire vine

You paint your toes and polish your jewels
Take yourself to victim school

Mary Lou, I renounce you

Like a crack run through my mind
You're a bathroom left behind

You took everything I left
But that's alright
I don't live in your past

You paint your face and sharpen your teeth
You chuck yourself on ancient meat

Mary Lou, Fu Fu Fuck you

On a road that's laid with thorns
May our feet be ripped and torn
But may you rise up through the blue

Mary Lou, I forgive you
