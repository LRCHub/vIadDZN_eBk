(Freddie Perren, Kenneth St. Lewis)

Ain't no good in goodbye
All it does is make me cry, yeah
Ain't no good in goodbye
All it does is make me cry

She did good things to make me happy
There were good times we shared laughing
Should have knocked on wood
Suddenly the good
Turned out to be not so good for me, whoa oh

Ain't no good in goodbye
'Cause every time I hear it,
I break down and cry
Ain't no fare in farewell
'Cause each time I say farewell (farewell)
I know it won't be very long
Can be a crying spell

(What you say?) I said
Ain't no good in goodbye
Said it ain't no good
All it does is make me cry, y'all
Ain't no good in goodbye
All it does is make me cry, y'all

Goodbye's got that double meaning
(Do do do do)
Goodbye forever until tomorrow evening
(Do do do do)
When my baby says goodbye (goodbye)
There was no doubt in my mind (my mind)
The wa she laid it down, she meant forever, whoa oh

Ain't no good in goodbye
'Cause every time I hear it,
I break down and cry
Ain't no fare in farewell
'Cause each time I say farewell (farewell)
I know it won't be very long
Can be a crying spell

(What you say?) I said
Ain't no good in goodbye
Said it no good, Lord it ain't no good
(All it does is make me cry)
Can't stand you leaving here, no
(Ain't no good in goodbye)
Oh, it ain't no good
(All it does is make me cry)

Oh, ain't no good
(Ain't no good in goodbye) in goodbye
'Cause every time I hear it,
I break down and cry
Said it ain't no fare (ain't no fare) in farewell
'Cause each time I say farewell (farewell)
I know it won't be very long
Can be a crying spell

Should have knocked on wood
(What you say?) I said
Ain't no good in goodbye
Said it ain't no good
(All it does is make me cry)
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
(Ain't no good in goodbye)
Ain't no good in goodbye, baby
(All it does is make me cry)
(Ain't no good in goodbye)
Ain't no good
