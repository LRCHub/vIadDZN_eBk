Goodbye, baby
Bye bye, honey
Goodbye, baby
Bye bye
Three years in this town and
I wanna leave town, the
Clubs have all shut down and
I have been dressed down

Goodbye, baby
Bye bye, honey
Goodbye, baby
Bye bye
I'm leavin' tonight and
I'm drivin' all night, you
Know I been thinkin' the
City is shrinkin'
